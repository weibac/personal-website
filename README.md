# personal-website

Live [here](https://weibac.github.io/personal-website/).

I will eventually get around to changing the URL, but I have had issues with the integration between my DNS provider and GH pages.
Thinking about self hosting.

Built with [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) using [this theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
